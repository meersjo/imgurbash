# imgurbash
Commandline Imgur uploader script, originally by Bart Nagels.

I found that this no longer worked, so made a repo to provide a fixed version. Bart Nagels, feel free to claim this if you care :-)

Initial fixy bits stolen from https://github.com/Ceryn/img/blob/master/img.sh - thank you for sharing :-)
